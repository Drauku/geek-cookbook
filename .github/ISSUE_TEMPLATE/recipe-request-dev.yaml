        First, some house-keeping. 
        ‚úÖ Review [closed issues](https://github.com/funkypenguin/geek-cookbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and [PRs](https://github.com/funkypenguin/geek-cookbook/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), and confirm that this recipe hasn't already been proposed, deprecated, or duplicated before. 
        ‚úÖ Confirm that the application itself is not abandoned by the developer
      options:
        - label: I have searched and confirmed no existing open or closed [closed issues](https://github.com/funkypenguin/geek-cookbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)/PRs for this app
          required: true
        - label: The app is actively supported by its developers (i.e., not deprecated or abandoned)

      label: Authentication
      description: |
        Does the app provide its own authentication (_i.e. NextCloud_), or does it require an authentication frontend (_i.e., Radarr_)?

        How should access to the app be managed?
      multiple: false
      options:
        - The app provides its own, trustworthy authentication, or access control is unnecessary. (*I'd be happy exposing it to the internet*)
        - The app needs something in front of it to secure access (_traefik-forward-auth, authelia, etc_)
